I've been working remotely from more than two years now, and I thought I'd add my own experience to the rather large amount of similar posts out there on the web.

First some background. I'm a long time Coveo employee, and before going remote I worked on-site for many years. I'm a Canadian who, having married a frenchwoman, now lives in France. My job is split between development and some management, with a strong emphasis on the former.

One particular (I think) aspect of my own situation is the 6h time difference between me and the home office. Also, I should note that most Coveo R&D staff are on-site, although we do have some other remote developers but none as far away than me.

# Communication

When thinking about remote work, communication is always the first topic coming up. I learned quickly that you can't depend only on email and scheduled meetings to properly interact with coworkers. Social relationships are built on more than strict information transfer; you need to form ties with your coworkers in order to create a productive environment. In an on-site setup this happens through casual conversations (the coffee machine comes to mind). In short, you need a way to hang out with the folks.

Here at Coveo we use Slack to host chat rooms dedicated to various topics. Each team typically has a room that members use to discuss various topics. Other employees can also use that channel to ask questions, enquire about issues they are having, etc. Discussions often fall outside of strictly work-related subjects, and that's a great thing for remote workers, as it replaces in part the casual conversations you'd have up in the hallway. Personally, I can't imagine working without that anymore.

Still, we only started using Slack about a year after I went remote. Before that, I had to find others ways to "bring me closer" to the folks at the office. What I came up is using a permanent Hangout running on an old laptop sitting in the office near my teammates. Whenever I'm working at the same time as folks in Quebec, I'll connect to this hangout and let the audio feed play on my laptop speakers. I also put the video feed in a small window in the corner of one of my (many) screens. This way, the hangout feels like a window to the office. I can hear conversations between my teammates, and jump in whenever I like (which I do quite often, being of the opinionated trollish kind).

Some might think that's creepy having a coworker essentially eavesdropping all conversations, but when you think about it I'd hear the same stuff if I was sitting there, and whenever I'm connected my face is shown on full screen, so it's pretty obvious I'm "here". In fact, I never had anyone complain about that situation.

I've read about other remote workers that seem to succeed without such gizmos, but personally I don't think I'd be able to do my job as well without them.

# Face time

4 or 5 times a year, I jump on a plane and go spend a week at the office. It's essentially a social operation; there is not really any task that *requires* me to be onsite. But by going there I'm able to meet people with whom I'd otherwise never talk just because we work on unrelated things, and I always use the opportunity to 

# Motivation

Working remotely - especially in a different time zone - is not for everybody. You'll often be the only employee online. Nobody is watching over your shoulder to see that you're not wasting your time. You need to love your job and feel motivated by it. If you're the kind of employee that needs surveillance to keep you away from spending you days browsing Reddit, either because you're lazy or you just hate what you do, please, for kittens sake do not ever consider doing that work remotely. You will suck at it. Hell, you probably already suck at it onsite anyway.

As it is, I don't think this problem occurs frequently. By hiring a remote worker (or retaining a well valued employee through this means) a company has a better pick of choice candidates than what is available in the local market. Better candidates have higher odds of being good, conscientious professionals. I do fear that once remote working becomes more mainstream such problems will start to appear.

# Concentration

The upside of being the only employee online is that the amount of interruptions at those moment has a tendency to get closer to 0. And, boy, isn't that great. Personally I spend a full half of my day in that situation, and I have never felt so productive. Every time I go back to the office for a week or two I wonder how I ever did work before. It's that good. I'm even thinking on-site workers should enforce "no-communications" period to let people focus on their tasks.

Sometimes I'll end up blocked by a bug in a module I don't maintain. Whenever this happens I have two choices: Either I switch to another task (easy, I'm a busy person), or I go and dig into the code myself. And you know what? I noticed I've been doing exactly that more than when I was on-site, and that my ability to grasp other people's code has improved as a result. That's a win in my book.

# Guilt

Remote workers, in many ways, enjoy a situation that might be seemed as privileged by others. Or anyway that is how they perceive it. I certainly do. I mean, I do not have to commute, and I'm able to work wherever I like, as long as I can get online. It's also great for family life, especially with younger kids. And I get to save on pants, too! (hey, kidding here)

The thing is, you feel guilty about that situation. Trust me on that. And what do I do to compensate? I work harder. And I'm [not the only one](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BeingARemoteWorkerSucksLongLiveTheRemoteWorker.aspx). I don't think I was ever considered a slacker while on-site, 

Overall I'm pretty sure that good remote workers will be among the hardest working persons in a company, just because of that overcompensating thing.

# Balance

Which brings me to the topic of work/life balance. Many articles about remote working mention the blurry line between work and home. Honestly, I haven't seen that much of a difference on my side, compared to when I worked on-site. If anything this changed for me the first time I got a laptop which I could bring home.

What's harder in my situation is the 6 hours timezone difference. Every evening I sign off work while the people at the office *continue working*. That feels weird. And them the emails keep coming in, and stuff is said on Slack, and things happen. And I'm not online, but I do see all of this on my phone. Honestly, it's hard not to jump in when you see someone's about to make a mistake, or that the proverbial fan got hit by... something. If I'd just shut down the phone, I couldn't avoid feeling guilty, and see above what happens then.

In the end, I see that as the downside of a situation that, for me, has a whole lot of advantages too, and in the end I'm OK with that.
