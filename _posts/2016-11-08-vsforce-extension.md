## My first Visual Studio Code extension

## The purpose of vsforce

### Why a salesforce extension
If you've been working with Salesforce, you know that the entire process of making and publishing code can be tricky and slow sometime. We've created [vsforce] in order to make the process much simpler and much quicker than it is right now for you to create, test and publish your code from your local machine. 

### Useful features
 - [Auto-complete, Syntaxe highlighting]
 - [Retrive/Deploy]
